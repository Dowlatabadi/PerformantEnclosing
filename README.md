**Minimum Enclosing Ball Simulation Algorithm**

This repository contains an implementation of the simple streaming algorithm for computing the minimum enclosing ball (or 1-center) of a set of points in high dimensions, as described in the article "A Simple Streaming Algorithm for Minimum Enclosing Balls".


***Algorithm Overview***

The algorithm is designed to compute a 3/2-factor approximation of the minimum enclosing ball in any dimension using minimum space and processing the data points in just one pass.


***Simulation Results***

To visualize the algorithm's performance, we have created four GIF files:

These GIFs demonstrate the algorithm's behavior in 3D space:

***How to Run the Simulation***

To run the simulation, simply clone this repository and execute the project.
